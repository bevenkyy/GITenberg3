# fff (*Fucking Fast File-Manager*)

<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/QBCXlA7qbkQPCcfdBGDoPUWiH" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/QBCXlA7qbkQPCcfdBGDoPUWiH.svg" alt="img" height="300px" align="right"/></a>

A simple file manager written in `bash`.

- It's Fucking Fast ðŸš€
- Minimal (*only requires **bash** and coreutils*)
- Smooth Scrolling (*using **vim** keybindings*)
- Supports `LS_COLORS`!
- File Operations (*copy, paste, rename, cut, etc*)
- Instant as you type search
- Automatic CD on exit (*see [setup](#cd-on-exit)*)


## Introduction

The entire program has been rewritten in **readable** bash. It's no longer 100 obfuscated lines and<br>
no longer has that restriction. Numerous bugs were discovered in the rewrite and have<br>
been all fixed. The program has been highly optimized now. The old version did a full screen<br>
redraw on every keypress while the new version redraws only when necessary<br>
(*Scrolling only redraws 2 lines now!*).

Take a peek at the source code. I've done my best to explain the non-obvious and tricky parts.

## Dependencies

- `bash 3.2+`
- program handling (non-text): `xdg-utils`
    - *Not needed on macos and Haiku.*
    - *Customizable (if not using `xdg-open`): `$FFF_OPENER`.*
- file operations: `coreutils`
- mime types: `file`


## Installation.

- Download `fff`.
- Put it somewhere in your `$PATH`.
- Run it.
    1. `fff` or `fff path/to/dir`, `fff ../../`, `fff /usr/share/`
    2. optional: `alias f="fff"`


### CD on Exit

```sh
# Example setup (bash) (in .bashrc)
f() { fff "$@"; cd "$(< ~/.fff_d)"; }

# Customization (temporary file to use)
# Default: '${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/fff/fff.d'
#          If not using XDG, '${HOME}/.cache/fff/fff.d' is used.
export FFF_CD_FILE=~/.fff_d


# Example setup (posix) (in .shellrc)
f() { fff "$@"; cd "$(cat ~/.fff_d)"; }
```


## Usage

```sh
j: scroll down
k: scroll up
h: go to parent dir
l: go to child dir

enter: go to child dir
backspace: go to parent dir

-: Go to previous dir.

g: go to top
G: go to bottom

.: toggle hidden files
/: search
t: go to trash
~: go to home
s: open shell in current dir
x: view file/dir attributes

down:  scroll down
up:    scroll up
left:  go to parent dir
right: go to child dir

f: new file
n: new dir
r: rename

y: mark copy
m: mark move
d: mark trash (~/.cache/fff/trash/)
p: paste/move/delete
c: clear file selections

[1-9]: favourites/bookmarks (see customization)

q: exit
```

## Customization

```sh
# Use LS_COLORS to color fff.
# (On by default if available)
# (Ignores FFF_COL1)
export FFF_LS_COLORS=1

# Directory color [0-9]
export FFF_COL1=2

# Status color [0-9]
export FFF_COL2=7

# Selection color [0-9] (copied/moved files)
export FFF_COL3=6

# Cursor color [0-9]
export FFF_COL4=1

# Text Editor
export EDITOR="vim"

# File Opener
export FFF_OPENER="xdg-open"

# CD on exit helper file
# Default: '${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/fff/fff.d'
#          If not using XDG, '${HOME}/.cache/fff/fff.d' is used.
export FFF_CD_FILE=~/.fff_d

# Trash Directory
# Default: '${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/fff/trash'
#          If not using XDG, '${HOME}/.cache/fff/trash' is used.
export FFF_TRASH=~/.cache/fff/trash

# Favourites (Bookmarks) (keys 1-9) (dir or file)
export FFF_FAV1=~/projects
export FFF_FAV2=~/.bashrc
export FFF_FAV3=~/Pictures/Wallpapers/
export FFF_FAV4=/usr/share
export FFF_FAV5=/
export FFF_FAV6=
export FFF_FAV7=
export FFF_FAV8=
export FFF_FAV9=
```

## Customizing the keybindings.

### Keybindings

This is the list of full keybindings along with their default values. You only need to modify the keybindings that you'd like to change from the default. `fff` will run perfectly fine without any of these defined.

```sh
### Moving around.

# Go to child directory.
export FFF_KEY_CHILD1="l"
export FFF_KEY_CHILD2="C" # Right Arrow
export FFF_KEY_CHILD3=""  # Enter / Return

# Go to parent directory.
export FFF_KEY_PARENT1="h"
export FFF_KEY_PARENT2="D"     # Left Arrow
export FFF_KEY_PARENT3=$'\177' # Backspace
export FFF_KEY_PARENT4=$'\b'   # Backspace (Older terminals)

# Go to previous directory.
export FFF_KEY_PREVIOUS="-"

# Search.
export FFF_KEY_SEARCH="/"

# Spawn a shell.
export FFF_KEY_SHELL="s"

# Scroll down.
export FFF_KEY_SCROLL_DOWN1="j"
export FFF_KEY_SCROLL_DOWN2="B" # Down Arrow

# Scroll up.
export FFF_KEY_SCROLL_UP1="k"
export FFF_KEY_SCROLL_UP2="A" # Up Arrow

# Go to top and bottom.
export FFF_KEY_TO_TOP="g"
export FFF_KEY_TO_BOTTOM="G"

# Go to dirs.
export FFF_KEY_GO_HOME="~"
export FFF_KEY_GO_TRASH="t"

### File operations.

export FFF_KEY_YANK="y"
export FFF_KEY_MOVE="m"
export FFF_KEY_TRASH="d"

export FFF_KEY_PASTE="p"
export FFF_KEY_CLEAR="c"

export FFF_KEY_RENAME="r"
export FFF_KEY_MKDIR="n"
export FFF_KEY_MKFILE="f"

### Miscellaneous

# Show file attributes.
export FFF_KEY_ATTRIBUTES="x"

# Toggle hidden files.
export FFF_KEY_HIDDEN="."
```

### Disabling keybindings.

You can't unset keybindings by making their value `''`. What you need to do is change their value to `off`.

Example:

```sh
# KEY_GO_TRASH was bound to 't', now its unset.
export FFF_KEY_GO_TRASH="off"

# KEY_MKFILE is now set to 't' and its original
# keybinding is also unset 'f'.
export FFF_KEY_MKFILE="t"
```

### Dealing with conflicting keybindings.

When rebinding a key in `fff` make sure you don't have two bindings with the same value. You can avoid this by setting the other conflicting key-binding to something else or by changing its value to `off`.


### How to figure out special keys.

You can verify the value of a keypress with the following command:

```sh
# Run this and press the desired key.
read -rn 1

# Left Arrow was pressed which is an escape sequence ('^[[D' or '\e[D']).
# 'read -n 1' uses the last character of escape sequences.
# Therefore the key-binding for the left arrow is 'D'.
âžœ read -rn 1
^[[Dâžœ [D
```

Below is a tiny script I've written which will tell you the exact value to use. It automates the deciphering of special key escape sequences to the exact value `fff` needs. Save this to a file and run it. Give it a key-press and it'll spit out the exact value needed.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Output the key-binding values for 'fff'.
key() {
    case "$1" in
        # Backspace.
        $'\b'|$'\177')
            printf '%s\n' "key: \$'\\b' or \$'\\177'"
        ;;

        # Escape Sequences.
        $'\e')
            read -rsn 2
            printf '%s\n' "key: ${REPLY: -1}"
        ;;

        # Return / Enter.
        "")
            printf '%s\n' "key: \" \""
        ;;

        # Everything else.
        *)
            printf '%s\n' "key: $1"
        ;;
    esac
}

read -srn 1 && key "$REPLY"
```
